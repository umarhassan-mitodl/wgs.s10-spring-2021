Reading Responses
-----------------

You will be graded on the evolution of your responses over the course of the class. Each entry should begin with one word that you think best describes the overall message of the text. You will then write about how you think that one word is evocative of the message of your chosen reading.

Podcast
-------

Student pairs or groups of three will produce a 6–10 minute podcast episode on a topic of their choosing related to the class content. Possible topics include but are not limited to:

*   Water quality in Boston neighborhoods
*   Environmental racism in Boston
*   Different framing of “crack babies” and “opioid dependent newborns”
*   Race and gender in different medical professions
*   Health care disparities by region, age, ability, race, etc.

Groups are encouraged to be creative with the podcast—to have fun and find ways to provide an informative and entertaining podcast. Students are encouraged to interview experts on the topic and find other content to bring into the podcast.

The episode must include an image to accompany the story, a transcript of the audio, a list of bibliographic sources, and an MP3 of no more than 10 minutes of audio.

The podcast will be 40 points of the final course grade.
